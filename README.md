interactclj - Interactive Clojure(Script) documentation

Static documentation is good, but interactive documentation is more fun! Thanks
to [Zach Oakes](https://github.com/oakes) and his
[dynadoc](https://github.com/oakes/Dynadoc) project creating interactive
examples for standard and non-standard Clojure(Script) functions is very easy.

The goal of this project is to show creative ways of using the standard
Clojure(Script) library, through interactive examples that can be executed and
modified using only a Web browser. Arguably all Clojure(Script) users that have
passed the beginner's stage can already do that (and probably much more) using
the REPL. But I still find it a good idea, especially for newcomers and people
who didn't have the chance so far to use Clojure(Script) extensively or
professionally.

Feel free to add your examples and submit a pull request.
